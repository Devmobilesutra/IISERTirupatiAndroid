<p><b>Ph.D.</b></p>

<p>Research at IISER Pune covers a wide range of research areas in Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics. In addition, we actively encourage research initiatives that span multiple disciplines.</p>

<p>IISER Pune offers modern research laboratories and computational facilities as well as comfortable housing for students selected into a graduate program at the institute. A core component of graduate student life at IISER Pune includes opportunities to participate in a broad range of seminars, meetings and workshops. This gives our students a chance to interact with people from other research organizations within the country and abroad.</p>

<p><strong>An Overview of the PhD programme at IISER Pune</strong></p>

<p>The PhD programme at IISER Pune is a blend of class room curriculum, mentoring under-graduate students along with a major research component. The research scholars are expected to complete at least 16 credits of course work within the first two semesters followed by a comprehensive examination to assess the student’s candidacy for PhD. They must deliver a departmental seminar and undertake tutoring activities in at least two under-graduate courses (theory and/or laboratory courses). In the first two years, the student will receive a Junior Research Fellowship (JRF). Upon the successful completion of the comprehensive examination and two years of JRF, the student will be eligible to receive a Senior Research Fellowship (SRF) for a maximum of another three years. The research progress of the student will be monitored by a Research Advisory Committee (RAC) involving the thesis supervisor (Convener) and two other faculty members. Upon completion of satisfactory research work (as construed by the RAC), the research scholar will deliver a research seminar regarding his/her work before the submission of thesis. The submitted thesis will be evaluated by external examiners before the conduct of viva-voce. Successful open defense of the thesis will lead to award of PhD degree during the annual convocation.</p>

<p>IISER Pune admits students to doctoral programme in <strong>Biology</strong>, <strong>Chemistry</strong>, <strong>Earth and Climate Sciences</strong>, <strong>Physics </strong>and <strong>Inter-disciplinary</strong>areas of research.
