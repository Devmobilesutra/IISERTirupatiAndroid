<div align="justify">

    <p>The PhD programme at IISER Tirupati was initiated in August 2017. It involves a combination
        of coursework, teaching assistantship along with a major research component. IISER Tirupati
        admits students to its doctoral programme in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Earth & Climate
        Sciences, and associated inter-disciplinary areas of research.</p>
    <p>Students with a Master's degree in Science / Mathematics or a four-year Bachelor degree with
        at least 55% marks (aggregate) are encouraged to apply to our PhD programme. In addition to
        the qualifying degree, we expect the students to have qualified a national examination such
        as CSIR-UGC NET/GATE/JEST/JGEEBILS, etc. depending on their area of research interest.
        Students will be selected to the PhD programme based on their performance in the interviews,
        which will be conducted once eligible candidates are shortlisted. The interviews typically
        will be held in two sessions, one during the summer session (~ May-June), and another during
        winter (~ November-December).</p>

    <p> The broad areas of research in each department include the following:</p>
    <p><strong>Biology:</strong>
        <br>Biophysics, Neuroscience, Plant biology, Ecology and evolution, Cancer biology &
        Immunology, Chemical Biology, Nano-Biotechnology, Proteomics and Infectious disease.
